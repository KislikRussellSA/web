  <p>
    Despite my size, I am easily scared by everything. Any slight sound or movement leaves me alert and anxious so I don't like to be left alone.
  </p>
  <p>I am known to be very goofy at times, always being spooked by the smallest things</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I always want to play and want to go outside but I have social anxiety so I can't be out for long.</p>

    <p class="p22"> After a strong 2022-23 season where Nikita averaged 15.2 points per game as a solid second scoring option for the East Valley Falcons, Nikita enters his
        junior season with a slow start. </p>
         <aside>
            <p>This can <b>only be</b> blamed on his lack of ball posession during games and the rising scoring of fellow juniors Lukas
            Carone and Itzak Salazar.

        <details><summary>How is Nikita working to improve his game?</summary>Nikita currently trains with a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJHZI3McmE4> push pull legs </a>split. However, he plays basketball at the gym
        <b><u>0</u></b> days of the week. Nikita hopes to improve his strength and overall body look with his training. Although he is slowly becoming more consistent with his
        workout split, his training does not translate to his skills on the basketball court. Nikita attends his team's basketball practice <b>some</b> days when possible, even if it
    takes place in the early mornings. </details>
        <details><summary>Will Nikita come back to his prime form?</summary> Although it's hard to say with his current performance, there is a sliver of hope for Nikita's basketball career as
        Nikita shows glimpses of being a solid contributor to the basketball team.</details>
        <details><summary>When can I watch Nikita play next?</summary>Nikita plays next on <b>Friday</b> against league rivals <b>SOCES</b>.</details>

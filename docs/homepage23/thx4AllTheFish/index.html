    <h1>Loveland Frog</h1>
    <p>The Loveland Frog is a humanoid frog creature living in Loveland, Ohio. It stands at about four feet tall.
            And yes, it stands. All the time. That's what makes it so freaky, and also one of my favorite cryptids: a frog that (gasp)
            STANDS UP! It's been spotted four times, but it was a high school student in a mascot costume one of
            those times. Sadly. After the second sighting, the guy that saw it originally came out and claimed that he shot it,
            and that it was just a stupid iguana with a big tail. but i know the truth. i know the loveland frog is real.
            the government cannot hide this from us. we know the truth. please donate to my investigation at <a href="thetruth.html">www.legalizelovelandfrogman.click/give-me-money</a></p>
        <p>there is also a musical about it. <a href="https://behindthecurtaincincy.com/2014/05/08/cff14-hot-damn-its-the-loveland-frog/">i'm not kidding.</a></p>

        <h2 class="bottom">Origin slash First Sighting</h2>
        <p>Stories behind the frog tend to vary, but they usually go something like this: a salesman was driving along a
            road in Ohio in the fifties, when he saw three HUGE frogs in the road. The frogs then STOOD. UP. it's not really clear
            what happened next. some say they ran away, but other, way, way cooler interpretations involve the frogs
            disappearing with the use of magic wands.

        <h2 class="bottom">Second and Third Sightings</h2>
        <p>In the seventies, a Loveland police officer was driving down the road when he came across a GIANT green thing in the road.
            He recounted it being about 4 feet long and having leathery skin. He then recalls it running to the side of the road, hunched over
            like a frog, before standing on two legs and climbing over the .. the thing that's on the side of the road. y'know. those. anyways,
            he told all his cop buddies and then a week or two later one of his friends saw what he believed was the exact same creature.
            so he shot it. as one does. And he took it back to the station where it was revealed to be.......................................
            ................................ an iguana. with no tail.
        </p>
        <button class="container">y'know.. this thing</button>
        <h2 class="bottom">dot dot dot OR WAS IT. (aka Fourth Sighting)</h2>
        <p>In 2016, while playing pokemon go with his girlfriend, some guy saw the Loveland frog.
            He watched its eyes reflect in the light as it rose out of the water and walked around on its hind legs. it turned out that the frog, at least
            this time, was some high schooler named Jim. Jim said, and this is a direct quote, “I've been obsessed with the Loveland frog since I was a little
            boy. He's like my idol. I dress up as him and go to the tunnel and hop around a few times a week. I sometimes make little chocolates shaped
             as flies and I'll eat them while I hop around. And no, I don't think it's weird.” and that may be the weirdest thing i've ever read. no further sightings
             have been reported since then. at least, not until i go and catch one for myself.
        </p>
        <h2 class="bottom">Cultural Impact</h2>
        <p>the Loveland frog has been commemorated in several ways. There is, of course, the musical mentioned earlier, called "Hot Damn, it's the Loveland frog!"
            the frog was also made the city mascot of Loveland in 2023. and lastly, the songs. To date, I have found five songs about the Loveland Frog. You can jam out to them <a href="LETSROCK.html">here.</a>

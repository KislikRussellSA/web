        <h1>Typing</h1>
        <p>I take pride in the fact that I can type > 80 wpm consistently (usually averaging 100 wpm). I used to be able to do this using <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak-DH</a>, but like cubing, I fell out of practicing it after the pandemic ended. I am still pretty fast with QWERTY, however.</p>

        <h2>My Keyboard</h2>
        <p>
            At home, I use a split keyboard, the <a href="https://mistelkeyboard.com/products/5e53c3254c6f41f25c914273fb3a4d8b">Mistel Barocco MD770</a>, which I got a couple years ago when it was on sale on Amazon.

        <h2>I Want to Relearn Colemak-DH</h2>
        <p>
            Aside from Colemak-DH, I have tried out a bunch of different keyboard layouts. I was always the fastest with Colemak-DH, but I have tried implementing other features such as <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">Home Row Mods</a>.

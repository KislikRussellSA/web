        <h1>Gaming</h1>
        <p>After elementary, I stopped playing games so regularly. I do still play them from time to time.</p>

        <h2>Smash HDR</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/HDR-Development/HDR-Releases">Smash HDR</a> is a mod for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. that aims to bring features from Super Smash Bros. Melee and <a href="https://projectplusgame.com/">Project M/+</a> as well as general gameplay balances. I manage to play it online using a Nintendo Switch emulator, <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/">Yuzu</a>, but I'm not very good at it. If I had more free time, I would most likely practice it more because it is very fun.

            I main the Ice Climbers! Their super difficult to master because you essentially have to control 2 separate characters at the same time. In vanilla Smash Ultimate, they can pull of some awesome combos!

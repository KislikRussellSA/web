            I am Garrett Kido a current junior at The Science Academy STEM Magnet.
            I have many intrests both inside and outside of schoool. But my current focus is on school.
            It is the biggest and most important part of my life currently, taking up the most time out of anything I do by a large margin.
            Hence why I think it is fitting that it is the feature topic on my home page.

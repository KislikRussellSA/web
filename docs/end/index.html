                <h3>What's in the database?</h3>
                <p>
                    An ERD, which stands for Entity Relationship Diagram, is a visual representation of the tables in a
                    database.
                    Here's the ERD for the mystery database:
                </p>
                <img src="/web/schema.png" width='1002' height='491'>
                <p>
                    If two tables are related, the matching columns, i.e. the ones you use in a JOIN, are connected by a
                    gray
                    arrow in the diagram.
                </p>
                <p>If you were to look at the data in this database, you would see that the tables are huge! There are
                    so many data
                    points; it simply isnâ€™t possible to go through the tables row by row to find the information you
                    need.
                </p>
                <h3>For example, how many people are in the database?</h3>
                <pre>
SELECT count(*)
FROM person;
                </pre>
                <h3>What do we know about these people?</h3>
                <pre>
SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;
                </pre>
                <h3>What are the possible values for a column?</h3>
                <pre>
SELECT DISTINCT type
FROM crime_scene_report;
                </pre>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="go-get-em" class="grid">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Go For It!</h3>
                <p>
                    You have enough info to start solving the mystery. You'll need to check the ERD and make some
                    reasonable assumptions, but there's nothing else you need!
                </p>

        <div class="grid">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Check your solution</h3>
                <h4>Did you find the killer?</h4>
                <pre>
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'name of the suspect');

SELECT value FROM solution;
                </pre>

        <h1>Cubing</h1>
        <p>I think it's a pretty cool hobby. I haven't really practiced it since the end of the pandemic, but I am still able to solve it pretty quickly! I mainly like a certain event called one-handed, which, as the name suggests, is when you solve the Rubik's Cube with only one hand.</p>

        <h2>Rubik's Cube Emulated through Scratch</h2>
        <p>If you want to try solving the cube (press the orange square in the bottom left hand corner to scramble it):</p>

        <h2>How I Solve The Cube</h2>
        <p>Most people who can solve a Rubik's cube will say they use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ron6MN45LY">Beginner's Method</a> or <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=CFOP_method">CFOP</a>. However, I use a method called <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=ZZ_method">ZZ</a>. It had a bit of a steep learning curve, and the times I get with it can be inconsistent. However, I find it surperior to CFOP for one-handed solving.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you read that right. The Loveland frog? Totally out there. One hundred percent.</p>
        <br>
        <p>...Okay, you deserve an explanation. Let's look at the original, 1955 sighting.</p>
        <p>Look at the image to the right. This is a depiction of the first encounter with the creature,
            where it pulled out its <b>magic wand</b> to teleport away. Now, adamant frog fans maybe be
            screaming, "but that's just ONE interpretation!" I absolutely, completely disagree. It would
            be pretty, pretty hard to forget whether or not THREE FROGS vanished into thin air. Meaning that
            there's a good chance that the frogs are just. Magic. Now, we don't know the exact parameters of
            the frogs' magic. We know at least two things: There are multiple of them, and they can teleport.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Let's consider the possibility of there being multiple frogs. Our traveling salesman friend saw
            three. We aren't completely sure whether or not this is all of them. Now, we know another Loveland frog was spotted in
            1976. I'm not talking about the iguana which, by the way, was definitely a different creature.
            <a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/static/documents/wildlife/backyard-wildlife/Pub%205354_Reptiles%20of%20Ohio%20Field%20Guide.pdf">
            Check out this GOVERNMENT website.</a> Two things stand out. One, the government is garbage at
            hiding the truth, because if the officials wanted to cover up the frog so badly you'd think they'd've
            thrown an iguana or two in there. And two... you'd think they'd've thrown an iguana or two in there.
            No big lizards in sight. So that iguana was a random occurrence.
            There probably aren't more of them.
            It was just some guy's pet that got loose. <img class="petitionimg" id="frogsighting.png" src="frogsighting.png" alt="https://peakd.com/cryptids/@numannvondeygan/the-loveland-frog">So now we can be absolutely sure that the first 1976 sighting
            was a big frog. Well, frogs have an average lifespan of 2 to 10 years in the wild. Even the longest-living
            frogs live a good forty years or so. Let's assume those three original frogs were well into their adulthood,
            because I <i>think</i> you'd remember if you saw three baby-shaped humanoid frogs. That, or they'd look like
            normal frogs and nobody would care. Since they don't live so long, we can safely say that the original three frogs have likely been long dead. So... there are totally more of them.
            Enough to mate and create more Loveland frogs. And since they're fairly smart (which we can tell by their response to the salesman encounter)
            there is absolutely a secret frog society.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Okay, now you're thinking "why come frog secret civilization never get caught?" And if you thought that, you
            should reread my second paragraph, stupid. It's not rocket science. The giant humanoid frog society gives magic
            wands to its young so that they can teleport away from harm. They also use their wands for other, non-teleportation purposes,
            such as wiping the memory of those who've seen them. Any encounters had with a Loveland frog have been quickly covered up, which is why so few exist today.
            The frogs also have some sort of shapeshifting powers. That's what allowed them to cover up the 2016 sighting.
            Consider it for a second. There is no way a HIGHSCHOOLER called """JIM""" actively DRESSES UP AS A FROG AND PRETENDS TO BE A FROG.
            And ANOTHER thing! """Jim's""" frog """costume""" seems to only be a frog's head, where the 2016 sighting was a full-body """costume!"""
            And worst of all. The government? They know. They know the frog society is out there. Why do you think Loveland's mascot is the frogman?
            It's not just some immortalization of a whimsical little story about a frog that can stand up. It's an offerring. It's their way
            of saying "hey, we love you, please don't hurt us!" Because these frogs? They hurt people. Why do you think the internet
            was losing it over Ohio in 2023? It's because that place is <i>weird.</i> <b>HELLA</b> weird. What makes it so weird?
            Paranormal activity. What causes paranormal activity? Cryptids. Including, but not limited to, big standing frogs
            with magic wands that cause trouble. Something must be done. And I must be the one to do it.

        <h2>The Plan?</h2>
        <p><b>Kill each and every last one of them.</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to locations of previous frog sightings.</li>
            <li>Analyze the area to find: why was the frog there?</li>
            <li>Create the perfect place for a frog to appear</li>
            <li>Stakeout. Wait in bushes. Month's worth of rations in my SUV</li>
            <li>Use a tranquilizer gun, not allowing the frog to teleport back</li>
            <li>Take frog's wand. Wait until frog wakes up</li>
            <li>Interrogate frog. Is it capable of speech? If not, kill</li>
            <li>If killed, get new frog. Give it wand. see what it does to teleport home</li>
            <li>If talks, ask it how to get to its secret civilization. bring weapons</li>
            <li>NO FROGS LEFT. I AM THE HERO OF OHIO</li>

## Practice labs

If you need to review, here are some labs covering a few of the topics we've already discussed, which you may need (hint, hint) to complete the assignment:

* [Syntax](https://lab.cs50.io/scienceacademy/labs/2020ap/syntax/)
* [Variables](https://lab.cs50.io/scienceacademy/labs/2020ap/variables/)
* [Operators](https://lab.cs50.io/scienceacademy/labs/2020ap/operators/)
* [Functions](https://lab.cs50.io/scienceacademy/labs/2020ap/functions)
* [`for` loops](https://lab.cs50.io/scienceacademy/labs/2020ap/forloop/)
* [`while` loops](https://lab.cs50.io/scienceacademy/labs/2020ap/whileloop/)
* [Booleans](https://lab.cs50.io/scienceacademy/labs/2020ap/booleans/)

> At the bottom of each lab, you can find a "cheat sheet" / study guide for that topic.

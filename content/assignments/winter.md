Practice the Create Performance Task.
<!--more-->

## Create PT practice

I'd like you to complete a Create PT practice.

For this practice, use your code from the "Plurality" assignment.

Open a new Google Doc, and answer the written questions found in section 3 of the AP CSP Student Handout (starts on page 7). Label each answer with the corresponding section & question number, ie 3c.i, 3b.ii, etc. Take note of the word limit, which is *per section*.

* Don't forget to identify and *explain* your examples of sequencing, selection, and iteration.

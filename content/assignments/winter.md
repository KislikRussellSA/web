Practice work to keep your brain going over the break.

## Create PT practice

I'd like you to complete a Create PT practice.

For this practice, use your code from either the "Filter" or "Plurality" assignments.

Open a new Google Doc, and answer the written questions found in section 3 of the AP CSP Student Handout (starts on page 7). Label each answer with the corresponding section & question number, ie 3c.i, 3b.ii, etc. Take note of the word limit, which is *per section*.

* Don't forget to identify and *explain* your examples of sequencing, selection, and iteration.

* This will be due by Jan 11. I'll put it on Schoology whenever it is set up for the next semester.

Enjoy your break and I'll see you all in January!

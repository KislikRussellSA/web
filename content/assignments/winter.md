Practice work to keep your brain going over the break.
<!--more-->

## 1. Create PT practice

I'd like you to complete another Create PT practice exam.

This time, use your code from either the "Recover" or "Filter" assignments.

Open a new Google Doc, and answer the written questions found in section 3 of the AP CSP Student Handout (starts on page 6). Label each answer with the corresponding section & question number, ie 3c.i, 3b.ii, etc. Take note of the word limit, which is *per section*.

* Don't forget to identify and *explain* your examples of sequencing, selection, and iteration.

* This will be due by Jan 11. I'll put it on Schoology whenever it is set up for the next semester.

## 2. Week 7 Lecture

You probably want to do this one towards the end of the break so it will be fresh in your minds. We'll be looking at and working with SQL when we return.

* [Week 7 Lecture Video](https://video.cs50.io/u5pDdEKnbKA?screen=-nHi1mI60oI)

* [Week 7 Lecture Notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ap/2021/curriculum/x/notes/7/)

Enjoy your break and I'll see you all in January!
